# Overview

The objective of this project is to provide a visual representation of the company's sales data. The dashboard displays information about revenue, sales trends, and customer behavior. The insights generated from the dashboard can be used to improve the company's sales and marketing strategies.

# Data Sources

The data used in this project is fictional and was generated for the purpose of demonstration. The data was stored in nine separate tables, which were imported into Power BI. The tables contained information about customers, products, orders, and sales. The data was preprocessed to ensure that it was clean and free of errors.

# Data Modeling

The data was modeled using Power BI's data modeling tools. Relationships were created between the different tables to enable the dashboard to display insights across multiple data sources. Calculated columns and measures were created to generate new insights from the data.

# Usage

To use the dashboard, download the Power BI file from the repository and open it in Power BI Desktop. The dashboard can be customized to display information specific to your own sales data by updating the data sources.
